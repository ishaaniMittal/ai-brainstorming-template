# AI-Powered Brainstorming Template

A structured approach for designers to brainstorm product ideas with AI assistance, focusing on strategic thinking and mental model discovery.

## Quick Start

1. **Clone this template** to your Kiro workspace
2. **Start brainstorming** with Kiro about any product design challenge
3. **Say "add this to threads"** when you want to capture an idea
4. **Use the guide** in `brainstorming-guide.md` for effective brainstorming patterns

> **Note**: This template uses Kiro's steering system for automatic workflow management. The methodology can be adapted for other AI assistants, but you'll need to manually provide the instructions from the steering file.

## What You Get

- **Structured file management**: Consistent formatting for captured ideas
- **Proven methodology**: Battle-tested patterns for moving from broad ideas to specific solutions
- **Strategic focus**: Frameworks that push beyond UI patterns to mental models and business strategy

## Files Included

- `brainstorming-guide.md` - Human guide for effective brainstorming methodology
- `.kiro/steering/brainstorming-workflow.md` - Kiro steering instructions for automatic workflow management

## Example Workflow

1. Start with a broad question: "How might designers work differently in 2030?"
2. Challenge assumptions: "But don't these tools already exist?"
3. Find current market reality: "What do companies actually want right now?"
4. Generate specific solutions: "Add this idea to threads"
5. Iterate and refine until you have actionable concepts

## Tips for Success

- Push for concrete examples over generic concepts
- Always ask "who would pay for this and why?"
- Connect ideas to current market timing
- Challenge whether roles/industries will remain unchanged
- Force specificity with "give me a concrete example"
