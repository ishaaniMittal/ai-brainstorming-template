# AI Brainstorming Template

A structured approach to brainstorm with AI using **Thread Pulling** and **Artifacts of Thought** patterns. Works with any AI coding assistant - no specific tool required.

## Quick Start

1. **Choose your IDE**: Kiro or Cursor
2. **Add the brainstorming instructions** to your AI assistant (see setup below)
3. **Start brainstorming** with any broad question
4. **Say "add this to threads"** to capture emerging ideas automatically
5. **Use "update AoT"** to track your thinking evolution

## Setup Instructions

### Kiro
The steering doc is already included in `.kiro/steering/brainstorming-workflow.md` - just start brainstorming!

### Cursor
1. Go to Settings â†’ Rules for AI
2. Copy the instructions from `.kiro/steering/brainstorming-workflow.md`
3. Paste them into your Rules for AI




## What You Get

- **Thread Pulling**: Capture and systematically explore interesting ideas without losing them in chat history
- **Artifacts of Thought**: Track how your thinking evolves within each session with living documents
- **Compound Learning**: Build on previous sessions instead of starting from scratch each time
- **Universal Workflow**: Works with any AI tool - choose what you're comfortable with

## Files Included

- `threads.md` - Template for capturing ideas to explore further
- `AoT.md` - Template for session summaries and insights
- `brainstorming-guide.md` - Methodology and best practices
- `.kiro/steering/brainstorming-workflow.md` - AI instructions (adapt for your IDE)

## Example Session Flow

```
You: "How might solo designers use AI in 2030?"
AI: [Shares several ideas about automation, strategy, etc.]
You: "Add this to threads" 
AI: [Automatically updates threads.md with structured format]
You: "Update AoT with our key insights so far"
AI: [Updates AoT.md with session summary]
You: "Let's dive deeper on thread #3"
AI: [Expands on that specific idea with full context]
```

## Why This Works

**Traditional AI brainstorming problems**:
- Ideas get buried in chat history
- Hard to build systematically on previous thoughts  
- No way to connect insights across sessions

**This template solves**:
- Persistent files that evolve with your thinking
- Structured format that forces clarity
- Searchable repository of all your brainstorming sessions

## Get Started

1. **Complete setup** for your IDE (see instructions above)
2. **Start simple**: Ask a broad question and try "add this to threads"
3. **Build the habit**: Use "update AoT" every 20-30 minutes
4. **Read the methodology**: Check `brainstorming-guide.md` for advanced patterns
