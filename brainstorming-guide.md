# Effective Brainstorming Guide

## Session Structure

### 1. Start Broad, Then Narrow
- Begin with future vision or big picture scenarios
- Let ideas flow without immediate constraints
- Gradually narrow to current market reality
- Find the bridge between "future state" and "what's possible now"

### 2. Challenge Every Assumption
Key questions to ask throughout:
- "But do tools for this already exist?" (differentiation check)
- "Will this role/industry even exist in the future?" (future-proofing)
- "What's the immediate market need?" (timing validation)
- "Is this solving a real problem people will pay for?" (business viability)
- "Are we being too optimistic about what's possible?" (reality check)

### 3. Force Specificity
- Push from generic concepts to concrete examples
- Replace vague terms with specific scenarios
- Connect abstract ideas to current market timing
- Use real company/user examples whenever possible

## Productive Patterns

### Problem Evolution Framework
1. **Future Vision**: "How might X work in 2030?"
2. **Reality Check**: "But a lot of this exists now, so what actually changes?"
3. **Market Reality**: "What do companies actually want right now?"
4. **Transition Opportunity**: "What helps people get from here to there?"

### Idea Validation Sequence
1. **Differentiation**: How is this different from existing solutions?
2. **Timing**: Why is this relevant right now?
3. **Market Need**: Who has this problem and will pay to solve it?
4. **Feasibility**: Can this be built with current capabilities?

### Specificity Forcing Techniques
- "Give me a concrete example of how this would work"
- "What specific problem does this solve that existing tools don't?"
- "Who exactly would use this and in what situation?"
- "What would the first version actually do?"

## Red Flags to Avoid

- Getting stuck on one idea too early
- Accepting generic solutions without pushing for specificity
- Ignoring current market reality
- Building for problems that don't exist yet
- Assuming roles/industries will remain unchanged

## Success Indicators

- Ideas become more specific and actionable over time
- Clear connection between current needs and future vision
- Concrete use cases that feel immediately valuable
- Differentiated approach from existing solutions
- Realistic assessment of what's possible now vs. later
