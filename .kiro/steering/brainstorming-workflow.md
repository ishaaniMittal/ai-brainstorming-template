# Brainstorming Workflow Instructions

## Threads File Management
- Always check if `threads.md` exists in the workspace root
- If `threads.md` doesn't exist, create it with the header "# Threads"
- Each idea should follow this exact format:
  ```
  ## [Number]. [Idea Name]
  
  **Name**: [Product/Tool Name]
  
  **Description**: [2-3 sentence description]
  
  **Brief Use Case**: [Specific scenario example]
  ```

## Adding Ideas
- When user says "add this to threads" or similar, append the new idea to threads.md
- Auto-increment the idea number based on existing ideas
- Maintain consistent formatting and spacing
- Always use the exact format specified above

## File Structure
- Use threads.md for brainstormed ideas
- Use AoT.md (Artifacts of Thought) for session summaries and next steps
- Keep ideas focused and actionable
- Each idea should be immediately understandable and specific

## Behavior Guidelines
- Don't update threads.md unless explicitly asked
- When adding ideas, read the current file first to get the correct numbering
- Maintain the established format exactly as shown
